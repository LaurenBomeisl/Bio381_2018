## My Spring Break

This is a small peek into my travels over spring break. I'll be sharing my intentions for this trip and some beautiful photos from my journey.

## Intentions

>-begin to close a chapter of my life
>-heal from stress through solitude in nature
>-connect with more people by traveling alone


## Objectives for the trip

- Come to a consensus with my former advisor on what story is most compelling from my MS prior to submitting for publication
- Backpack from Waipio valley to Waimanu valley
- Take the train up the pacific coast from LA to SLO

##Reframing my MS thesis

\color{violet} It was so good to see my former advisor in Portland, Oregon.  I'm very excited for her-- she's having a baby this June! 

We had a really productive meeting, and discussed the following:

>- conceptual diagrams (see homework #2) 
>- reframing my research questions through a different lens while maintaining consistent objectives 
>- journals/target audience


##Backpacking in Hawaii (The Big Island)

\color{blue}Unfortunately the rainy season was in full force by the time I arrived in Hawaii. I was hesitant to follow through on my plans to backpack along a steep ridge (heavily eroded due to rain) to a super remote valley (risk of flash flooding) knowing the only way out if in need of help would be helicopter rescue. Once I got to the island, I changed my plans completely. I was a little bummed at first, having considered this hike for the last 5 years, but I'm so glad I changed my plans and adapted to the weather-- sometimes you just gotta follow the wave!

##Waipio Valley -- Top View

 While I didn't make it to Waimanu, 
 I still hiked down to the valley, 
 and enjoyed a relaxing day in my hammock.

##Maui--Iao Valley

I also hopped on over to Maui to visit a friend who is living in Haiku. I was able to take a trip to the wettest place on earth-- Iao Valley! The landscape here is constantly changing due to water erosion-- the Iao valley monument is a testament to the power of water!

##Onto LA

I'm on my flight to LA now, and I'll be taking the train to SLO tomorrow! I'm looking forward to grading critical reflections while staring out onto the rugged pacific coast.
